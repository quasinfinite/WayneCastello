			<h3>Estate Planning</h3>
			<p>Planning the estate of you and your family is a great investment for the future of your financial stability. Dealing with the IRS is always tricky especially when it comes to your investments. This is a great opportunity to put these woes into the hands of an attorney experienced in tying up loose ends.</p>
			<h3>Trust Administration</h3>
			<p>Sometimes the best way to keep your savings is to put it into the hands of a third party. Setting up a trust is generally the best way to accomplish this. A trust serves as a legal entity that protects your money and gives it legal rights and restrictions that any business or entity is allowed.</p>
			<h3>Wills and Probate</h3>
			<p>Dealing with the death of a loved one is always tough and never an ideal situation. The law in regards to the end of life is not any easier. Mr. Castello has decades of experience handling the affairs of loved ones who are left with a confusing mess of legal problems.</p>
			<h3>Real Estate and Title Insurance</h3>
			<p>Looking to buy or sell your home? Before you step into any large investment, it's important to seek out some legal representation. Mr. Castello is a representative of First American Title Insurance and has the resources at his disposal to secure and sell the title to your home. </p>
